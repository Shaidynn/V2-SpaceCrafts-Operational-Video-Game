# V2-SpaceCrafts-Operational-Video-Game
A video game that I programmed which functions!

In order to run this code, you will need to add the following files to a specific folder on your computer, which holds all the code that I have written along with the downloaded sound effects and the digital images I have used. You will need to direct the following files to the same folder that holds the code as well.
